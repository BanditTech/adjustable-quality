[mod-setting-description]
uncommon_level=Adjusts the scaling of quality tiers. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
rare_level=Sets the level of Rare quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
epic_level=Sets the level of Epic quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
legendary_level=Sets the level of Legendary quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
beacon_power_usage_divisor=Divisor for calculating Beacon power usage for all levels. Larger values have more effect.
mining_drill_resource_drain_divisor=Divisor for calculating Mining drill resource drain for all levels. Larger values have more effect.
uncommon_science_pack_drain=Science pack drain for Uncommon quality (percentage). Smaller values have more effect.
rare_science_pack_drain=Science pack drain for Rare quality (percentage). Smaller values have more effect.
epic_science_pack_drain=Science pack drain for Epic quality (percentage). Smaller values have more effect.
legendary_science_pack_drain=Science pack drain for Legendary quality (percentage). Smaller values have more effect.
uncommon_next_probability=Determines how much of the chance to upgrade an item carries over to the next tier from uncommon. Larger values have more effect.
rare_next_probability=Determines how much of the chance to upgrade an item carries over to the next tier from rare. Larger values have more effect.
epic_next_probability=Determines how much of the chance to upgrade an item carries over to the next tier from epic. Larger values have more effect.
