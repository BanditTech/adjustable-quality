[mod-setting-description]
normal_level=Sets the level of normal quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
uncommon_level=Sets the level of Uncommon quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
rare_level=Sets the level of Rare quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
epic_level=Sets the level of Epic quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
legendary_level=Sets the level of Legendary quality items. Each level is used as a multiplier for all modifiable aspects of an entity (stats with blue diamond). Larger values have more effect.
beacon_power_usage_divisor=Divisor for calculating Beacon power usage for all levels. Larger values have more effect.
mining_drill_resource_drain_divisor=Divisor for calculating Mining drill resource drain for all levels. Larger values have more effect.
normal_next_probability=Changes how often quality modules upgrade normal items to uncommon. 0.1 keeps the default probability, 0.05 halves it, 0.2 doubles it.
uncommon_next_probability=Changes how often quality modules upgrade uncommon items to rare. 0.1 keeps the default probability, 0.05 halves it, 0.2 doubles it.
rare_next_probability=Changes how often quality modules upgrade rare items to epic. 0.1 keeps the default probability, 0.05 halves it, 0.2 doubles it.
epic_next_probability=Changes how often quality modules upgrade epic items to legendary. 0.1 keeps the default probability, 0.05 halves it, 0.2 doubles it.
